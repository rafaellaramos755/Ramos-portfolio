# My Web Portfolio

 About 
I'm a BSIT student with a strong interest in exploring the world of technology and continuous learning. I enjoy discovering new skills and applying them both in school and in my hobbies. 
Outside academics, I like creating digital art, playing online games, and being active in volleyball. I value friendship, creativity, and growth in everything I do.

## Reflection
This project helped me understand how to use GitHub for version control and hosting. I learned how to structure a responsive website, upload files to a repository, and deploy using GitHub Pages. It also gave me hands-on experience in making my portfolio accessible online, which will be useful for future professional opportunities.
